Evagoras Makridis received his B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from [Cyprus University of Technology](https://www.cut.ac.cy) in June 2017, and his M.Sc. degree in Autonomous Systems from [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://kth.se) and [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi) holding an excellence scholarship from [EIT Digital](https://www.eitdigital.eu). After his B.Sc. graduation he worked as Research Assistant at the [University of Lincoln](https://www.lincoln.ac.uk) (United Kingdom) through the Erasmus+ placement, and at Aalto University (Finland), until he joined [TRG Research and Development](https://www.trgint.com) as a full-stack software developer. During his M.Sc. studies, he worked in academia as a Research Assistant in both Aalto University and KTH Royal Institute of Technology, as well as in industry with [Ericsson AB](https://www.ericsson.com/en) to pursue his M.Sc. thesis "Reinforcement Learning for Radio Resource Management in 5G-NR Networks".

His research interests are in autonomous systems and more specifically in networked control systems, and data-driven sequential decision-making (Reinforcement Learning), with applications in quadrotor navigation, resource management, and wireless link adaptation and scheduling.
